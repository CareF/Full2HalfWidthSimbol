## Introduction
This is a Sublime Text package for changing punctuation of full and half width. 

I develop and test the package under Sublime Text 3 and Windows 10 but I 
shall not use anything not supported by other platform. If anyone found 
it cannot run under Sublime Text 2 or other OS, please contact me. 

## Usage
Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to call the panel, call the command `Full2HalfWidthSimbol: Switch`
